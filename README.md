Hello and welcome to ROROPD's Birthday Repository.


[1] Tests can be found in the "tests" folder.
Please navigate to it and run the "test_main.py" file.
We recommend running the code using this command:

$python test_main.py

This is because when running it with coverage3 some of the code would repeat
itself 3 times, ruining the test outputs.


[2] We ask that you sign-up to our user database.
Please navigate to the folder "scripts" and run "sign_up.py".
When running it make sure to remember to insert your USERNAME and PASSWORD.

E.g.
$python sign_up.py your_username_here your_password_here


[3] After having succesfully signed-up you may now run "main.py".
Navigate back out of the scripts folder and run "main.py".
When running it make sure to remember to insert your sign-up credentials
 (USERNAME and PASSWORD) as well as the names of two individuals who you would
 like to know the birthday of (NAME AND SURNAME of each).

E.g.
$python main.py -credentials your_username_here your_password_here -names
 "name surname" "name surname"
